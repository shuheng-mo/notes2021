    "When working on technical software development projects it's often the case that you'll spend as much (if not more) time debugging, compared to writing, 'actual' code. This statement alone should make one thing abundantly clear, debugging is important and in order to increase your productivity you _need_ to get good at it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the course of time as you develop/encounter code with bugs, fix them and repeat this process countless times these are skills you will be 'forced' to acquire naturally. But as with everything, when starting out it doesn't hurt to get a few tips from sources who have spent too much time searching for that elusive typo in the middle of a million lines of code. Thus, this lecture aims to provide you with a few tips and tricks to help you on your journey to becoming a debugging guru."

When working in an unfamiliar language it is therefore important to quickly find the right tools to suit your debugging style - for example we'll first look at a couple of manual debugging strategies utilizing `print` statements and `IPython`, how would we transfer similar techniques to `c++`?

    "There have been some infamous 'bugs' throughout history, here are a few:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### _The world’s first computer bug?_\n",
    "\n",
    "On September 9th, 1947 at 3:45 p.m., Grace Murray Hopper logged in her log book the first computer bug! Her log read: \"First actual case of bug being found\". The term \"bug\" in computer science is now, of course, not taken literally. It is used to describe a flaw or failure in a computer program that causes it to produce an unexpected result or crash.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### _The Y2K bug_\n",
    "\n",
    "The *year 2000* problem spawned fears of worldwide economic collapse, nuclear war, and led to an industry of consultants providing last-minute fixes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scary stuff, but clearly a bit over exaggerated. Nevertheless, the bug was real and billions of dollars were spend world wide fixing the bug. Indeed, not all systems were fixed in time and in Spain some parking meters failed, the French meteorological institute published the weather for 19100 and in Australia some ticket validation machines failed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### _The Dhahran Missile_\n",
    "\n",
    "But on a more serious note, a bug in the software of an MIM-104 Patriot caused its system clock to drift by one third of a second over a period of one hundred hours - resulting in failure to locate and intercept an incoming Iraqi Al Hussein missile, which then struck Dharan barracks, Saudi Arabia (February 25, 1991), killing 28 Americans.\n",
    "\n",
    "And here are some of the more 'interesting' bugs you may encounter while developing software:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### _The Heisenbug_\n",
    "\n",
    "From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heisenbug#See_also):\n",
    "\n",
    "_In computer programming jargon, a heisenbug is a software bug that seems to disappear or alter its behavior when one attempts to study it. The term is a pun on the name of Werner Heisenberg, the physicist who first asserted the observer effect of quantum mechanics, which states that the act of observing a system inevitably alters its state. In electronics the traditional term is probe effect, where attaching a test probe to a device changes its behavior._\n",
    "\n",
    "#### _Mandelbug_\n",
    "\n",
    "Mandelbugs do not change their properties or vanish like Heisenbugs. Instead, they are so unusual and complex that there is typically no practical solution to fix them. In fact, Mandelbugs may be so nondeterministic that many scholarly developers believe that fractal mathematics inventor Benoit Mandelbrot developed the Mandelbug to drive developers insane.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### _Bohrbug_\n",
    "\n",
    "A software bug which manifests reliably under a well-defined, but possibly unknown, set of conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### _Schroedinbug_\n",
    "\n",
    "A software bug which manifests only when somebody debugging it finds out that it shouldn't work at all."

    "They are several static analysis tools in Python (most of which you're already familiar with); to name a few:\n",

    "If you do have a non trivial bug, this is when debugging strategies kick in. There is no silver bullet. Yet, strategies help:\n",

    "\n",
    "When approaching someone for help debugging a problem, it is considered good practice to provide them with an MFE. This will often drastically reduce the time taken for them to debug the problem. Further, when contributing to an open source project and reporting a problem (e.g. opening a bug report issue on Github), the developers will frequently ask 'Please could you provide an MFE'.\n",
