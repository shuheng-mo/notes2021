    "### Enviroment variables\n",
    "\n",
    "From Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable):\n",
    "\n",
    "_An environment variable is a dynamic-named value that can affect the way running processes will behave on a computer. They are part of the environment in which a process runs. For example, a running process can query the value of the TEMP environment variable to discover a suitable location to store temporary files, or the HOME or USERPROFILE variable to find the directory structure owned by the user running the process._\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, one important environment variable is the **PATH** variable. To view the value of this variable, on a **Unix** machine you can type\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "echo $PATH\n",
    "```\n",
    "or on a windows machine\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "echo %PATH%\n",
    "```\n",
    "The variable is a list of directory paths. When the user types a command without providing the full path, this list is checked to see whether it contains a path that leads to the command.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the values of environment variables govern how certain as aspects of your environment function, e.g. which executables and libraries will be called/accessed by default, or which options will be used when executing certain commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why do we need a virtual environment?\n",
    "\n",
    "You're also now familiar with the `Python` package manager `pip`. Consider the following two 'dummy' packages and their requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Package **A**, has the following dependencies:\n",
    "    - a, version >= 1.0\n",
    "    - b, version 1.2\n",
    "    - c, version >= 2.2\n",
    "    - d, version >= 5.0\n",
    "- Package **B**, requires:\n",
    "    - a, version >= 1.0\n",
    "    - b, version >= 1.3\n",
    "    - e, version 1.0\n",
    "    - f, version >= 7.0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reviewing the above, we can see there is a conflict for the dependency b. Clearly, using `pip` to switch between two versions of package `b` every time want to use **A** or **B** is not a good solution. But further, in reality, when working on larger development projects such dependency conflicts may arise for several, or even dozens(!), of packages. Clearly, a better solution is to have both versions of the software installed and an easy way to switch between the appropriate environment variables when using either **A** or **B**. This is where _virtual environments_ come in handy.   \n",
    "\n",
    "A virtual environment is a tool that helps to keep dependencies required by different projects separate by creating isolated python virtual environments for them. This is one of the most important tools that most Python developers use.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When and where to use a virtual environment?\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, every project on your system will use the same directories (defined via environment variables) to store and retrieve site packages (third party libraries). Why does this matter? In the above example of two projects, you have two versions of package `b`. This is a real problem for Python since it can't differentiate between versions in the \"site-packages\" directory. So both v1.2 and v1.3 would reside in the same directory with the same name. This is where virtual environments come into play. To solve this problem, we just need to create two separate virtual environments, one for each project. The great thing about this is that there are no limits to the number of environments you can have since they're just directories containing a few scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Along with the above example, we may also want to make use of virtual environments because\n",
    "- Sometimes packages have the same name, but do different things, creating a namespace clash.\n",
    "- Sometimes you need a clean environment to test your package dependencies in order to write your `requirements.txt` file (we will talk more about such files later).\n",
    "\n",
    "### venv\n",
    " \n",
    "Python comes with an [inbuilt library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) called `venv` which can be used to create so-called \"virtual environments\". Inside a virtual environment, only the packages and tools you explicitly choose to copy across are available, and only at the version numbers you request. This gives a quick, easy access to a \"clean\" system, be it for testing, or to run mutually incompatible software.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a new `venv` environment you can run a command like\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python -m venv foo\n",
    "```\n",
    "or, on systems with both Python 2 and Python 3 available,\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python3 -m venv foo\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will create a new directory `./foo/` containing the files relevant to that virtual environment. To start the environment on Windows run\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "foo\\Scripts\\activate.bat\n",
    "```\n",
    "or on unix shell like systems\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "source foo/bin/activate\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To disable the environment, on windows systems run\n",
    "```bash\n",
    ".\\foo\\Scripts\\deactivate.bat\n",
    "```\n",
    "or, in most unix based shells\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "deactivate\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Building a `requirements.txt` file using `venv`\n",
    "\n",
    "Switching to a `venv` environment is one way to build up a short list of required packages for a new project. You can start up a blank environment and then try to build and run your code. If a dependency is missing, this should fail with an `ImportError` message, something along the lines of\n",

An exact copy of the python or python3 binary is placed in this directory, but Python is programmed to look for libraries relative to its path first, in the environment directory.

(Although we could have also continuously updated our environment file and then updated our environment via `conda env update -f environment.yml`).\n",
    "- In any case, we generally want both for people making use of our package who are not using `Anaconda`. As we saw earlier, we could use such a requirements file in `venv`.\n",
    "- Additionally, what if we want some packages to not be installed automatically when creating our environment? For various reasons, we may with to have an, e.g. `requirements-optional.txt` file present (generally the packages listed in `environment.yml` and `requirements.txt` should be in sync unless there's a good reason for them not to be). Any such optional requirements can be installed via the `pip install -r ... .txt` command once again.\n",
