    "# Pandas - https://pandas.pydata.org/\n",
    "\n",
    "From: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandas_%28software%29\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas is a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis. In particular, it offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series. It is free software released under the three-clause BSD license. The name is derived from the term \"panel data\", an econometrics term for data sets that include observations over multiple time periods for the same individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas is mainly used for Machine Learning in the form of dataframes. Pandas allows importing data in various formats such as csv, excel etc. Pandas allows a range of data manipulation operations such as `groupby`, `join`, `merge`, `melt`, concatenation as well as data cleaning features such as filling, replacing or imputing null values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key features:\n",
    "* `DataFrame` object for data manipulation with integrated indexing.\n",
    "* Tools for reading and writing data between in-memory data structures and different file formats.\n",
    "* Data alignment and integrated handling of missing data.\n",
    "* Reshaping and pivoting of data sets.\n",
    "* Label-based slicing, fancy indexing, and subsetting of large data sets.\n",
    "* Data structure column insertion and deletion.\n",
    "* Group by engine allowing split-apply-combine operations on data sets.\n",
    "* Data set merging and joining.\n",
    "* Hierarchical axis indexing to work with high-dimensional data in a lower-dimensional data structure.\n",
    "* Time series-functionality: Date range generation and frequency conversion, moving window statistics, moving window linear regressions, date shifting and lagging.\n",
    "* Provides data filtration.\n",
    "\n",
    "The library is highly optimized for performance, with critical code paths written in `Cython` or `C`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bottom line - if you are doing anything related to with spreadsheets you should (probably) be using Pandas.**\n",

    "## Pandas tutorials\n",

    "Further, if you are interested in data science and machine learning then you need to know about Kaggle. You will use it a few times throughout the year. An introduction can be found [here](https://youtu.be/TNzDMOg_zsw).\n",

    "`iloc` is conceptually simpler than `loc` because it ignores the dataset's indices. When we use `iloc` we treat the dataset like a big matrix (a list of lists), one that we have to index into by position. `loc`, by contrast, uses the information in the indices to do its work. Since your dataset usually has meaningful indices, it's usually easier to do things using loc instead. For example, here's one operation that's much easier using loc:"

    "#### Choosing between loc and iloc\n",
    "\n",
    "When choosing or transitioning between `loc` and `iloc`, there is one \"gotcha\" worth keeping in mind, which is that the two methods use slightly different indexing schemes.\n",
    "\n",
    "`iloc` uses the Python `stdlib` indexing scheme, where the first element of the range is included and the last one excluded. So `0:10` will select entries `0,...,9`. `loc`, meanwhile, indexes inclusively. So `0:10` will select entries `0,...,10`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why the change? Remember that `loc` can index any `stdlib` type: strings, for example. If we have a `DataFrame` with index values Apples, ..., Potatoes, ..., and we want to select \"all the alphabetical fruit choices between Apples and Potatoes\", then it's a lot more convenient to index `df.loc['Apples':'Potatoes']` than it is to index something like `df.loc['Apples', 'Potatoet']` (`t` coming after `s` in the alphabet).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is particularly confusing when the `DataFrame` index is a simple numerical list, e.g. `0,...,1000`. In this case `df.iloc[0:1000]` will return `1000` entries, while `df.loc[0:1000]` return 1001 of them! To get 1000 elements using `loc`, you will need to go one lower and ask for `df.loc[0:999]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Otherwise, the semantics of using `loc` are the same as those for `iloc`."

    "### Combining\n",
    "\n",
    "When performing operations on a dataset, we will sometimes need to combine different `DataFrame`'s and/or `Series` in non-trivial ways. Pandas has three core methods for doing this. In order of increasing complexity, these are `concat()`, `join()`, and `merge()`. Most of what `merge()` can do can also be done more simply with `join()`, so we will omit it and focus on the first two functions here.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest combining method is `concat()`. Given a list of elements, this function will combine those elements together along an axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is useful when we have data in different `DataFrame`'s or `Series` objects but having the same fields (columns).\n",
    "\n",
