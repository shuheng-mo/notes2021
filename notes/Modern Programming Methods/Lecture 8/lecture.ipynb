    "## What is Continuous integration?\n",
    "\n",
    "In software development, Continuous Integration (CI) is the practice of developers integrating code into a shared repository several times a day. Each 'push' to the repository is then verified by automated testing tools, allowing any problems to be detected early.\n",
    "\n",
    "And, from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration):\n",
    "\n",
    "_In software engineering, continuous integration (CI) is the practice of merging all developers' working copies to a shared mainline several times a day. Grady Booch first proposed the term CI in his 1991 method, although he did not advocate integrating several times a day. Extreme programming (XP) adopted the concept of CI and did advocate integrating more than once per day – perhaps as many as tens of times per day._\n",
    "\n",
    "## Automated Continuous integration\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have tests, you want to make sure that any public changes to the code don't break them. For code held under version control, this means that you ideally want to rerun your test suite on all new public merges, to ensure that the code installs and runs successfully on a clean system. Continous integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) frameworks tie together version control repositories and test suites so that this happens automatically whenever a commit to production code (i.e. your _master_ branch) is proposed, or even whenever any change is commited anywhere in the repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to first ensure that the production branch always works, so that pure users can trust they will always be able to use it securely. Meanwhile, developers can feel safe in repeatedly merging changes to and from the master version and knowing whether their code works or not. At its furthest, under the doctrine of Extreme Programming (XP), this might mean work can merged multiple times a day by every developer among moderately sized teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "XP workflows stress the following points:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Merge back to master frequently (i.e keep feature changes small and atomic )\n",
    " - Automate the software build\n",
    " - Automate the testing framework"

    "## Some CI solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "As with test frameworks, a large number of CI/CD solutions exist, e.g.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/) is a hosted continuous integration service used to build and test software projects hosted at GitHub and Bitbucket.\n",
    " - [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io), a free, open source CI tool which you can run on your own machine. Popular with Java developers.\n",
    " - [Buildbot](https://buildbot.net) - Another self-run CI tool, written and configured with Python.\n",
    " - [Azure Pipelines](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/devops/pipelines/) -  A cloud system like Travis, this time run by Microsoft\n",
    "    \n",
    "and of course, the main CI pipeline we will learn about today\n",
    "    \n",
    " - [Github Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions), which allows building continuous integration and continuous deployment pipelines for testing, releasing and deploying software without the use of third-party websites/platforms\n",
    " \n",
    "All the above CI solutions require their own setup files, which have many of the same concepts, but different syntax. For example, Azure Pipelines uses a file called `azure-pipelines.yml`, which looks like\n",
    "\n",
    "```yml\n",
    "trigger:\n",
    "- master\n",
    "\n",
    "pool:\n",
    "  vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'\n",

    "As you will see, this is very similar to the Github Actions `.yml` files we will explore shortly, although the syntax and available functionality will of course vary.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, which CI framework to use is rarely a true choice. Businesses and existing projects will have picked and offer support for one, and expect you to play nicely with it. Meanwhile for personal projects people want minimum effort, minimum cost solutions. On these two metrics Github Actions scores very highly.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also worth noting that Github Actions is a relatively new CI solution, having been added to Github in 2019. It is therefore undergoing continuous development and new features are being added and existing ones enhanced regularly.\n",

For this basic exercise you can assume that the input is real and between 0 and $2\\pi$ radians.\n",

    "## Some other useful Github Actions workflow features\n",
    "\n",
    "#### cron jobs\n",
    "\n",
    "It is often useful to have workflows trigger on a [schedule](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#onschedule). Such a schedule can be define using [POSIX cron syntax](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/crontab.html#tag_20_25_07). Take for example the following snippet:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yml\n",
    "on:\n",
    "  schedule:\n",
    "    - cron:  '0 3 11,25 * *'\n",
    "```\n",
    "This states that the workflow should be executed at 0 minutes, 3 hours on the 11 and 25 day of every month of every year.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### workflow_dispatch\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes it's handy to have a 'push button' to run your tests. This is available via the a [workflow_dispatch](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#workflow_dispatch) - an example of which is given in the following snippet:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yml\n",
    "on:\n",
    "  workflow_dispatch:\n",
    "    inputs:\n",
    "      tags:\n",
    "        description: 'Run this workflow'\n",
    "```\n",
    "This introduces a 'Run Workflow' button on the Actions tab under the relevant workflow as shown in the image below\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"figures/actions2.png\" width=1000 height=1000 />\n",
    "\n",
    "#### strategy: fail-fast\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, is a job fails the workflow will not progress beyond this job. Sometimes this is not the behavior required. This can be altered by setting the `fail-fast` flag to `false`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yml\n",
    "  my-job:\n",
    "    needs: my-last-job\n",
    "    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n",

    "      ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step `output`'s\n",
    "\n",
    "A value from one step can be used in a sub-sequent step (if we don't wish to use environment variables) via (e.g. generate some `python` argument):\n",

    "    - name: Make some value\n",
    "      run: |\n",

    "        python --${{ steps.msv.outputs.some_output }} my_file.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `if` statements\n",
    "\n",
    "In many workflows we will want some steps to run under one condition and other steps to run under a different one. This can be achieved via `if` statements. An example is shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yml\n",
