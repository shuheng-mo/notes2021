    "A rubber ball is dropped from a height `h_0`. After each bounce, the height it rebounds to decreases by 10%, i.e. after one bounce, it reaches `0.9*h_0`, after two bounces it reaches `0.9*0.9*h_0`, etc. Write a Python function `compute_heights` that returns a list of the maximum heights of the ball after each bounce (including after 0 bounces, i.e. its initial height), until either the ball has bounced `n` times *or* its maximum height falls below `h1`. The function should take `h_0`, `h_1` and `n` as keyword arguments, with default values of `1.0`, `0.3` and `10`, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "**HINT:** If `n` bounces of the ball are not reached, the last value of height in the list should be the first height at which the ball fell below `h1`. More precisely, the last value is less than `h1`."
